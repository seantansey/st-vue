        As a bootcamp/self taught Software Engineer Ive often felt I lacked
        understanding of many computer science concepts. These simply weren't things I was taught when
        I learned how to code. I became a strong practical and pragmatic programmer, but often struggled 
        (and felt foolish) trying to articulate issues I was running into with more senior engineers on 
        projects. I've had to pick up and learn many new concepts along the way and below is a collection 
        of those lessons and gotchas.
